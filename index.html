                <li>It is the number of members that determines the influence of the trade union movement.</li>
                <li>It is we who organized who created the welfare state - and it is we who must defend it.</li>
                <li>Fellesforbundet gives those organized in a workplace the tools to fight for better pay and working conditions.</li>
                <li>Over a hundred years of history have shown us that it is only when we stand together that we can manage to get our fair share of the values that are created in the company and society.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> 
                As a trade unionist in Fellesforbundet, you have many advantages, both in terms of salary, working hours and other social conditions. 
                In addition, you get good insurance and other good membership benefits e.g. on rental car, holidays / experiences, mobile telephony / broadband through LOfavør.

            <p>LOCAL NEGOTIATIONS:</p><br>
            <p>We are currently under local sallary negotiations. This means we might get raise and some additional perks at work. Stay tuned for updates.</p><br>
            <p>08 july 2022: We asked for 6 kroner pr hour but got offered 1 kr/h for all plus 1 kr/h extra (2 kr/h total) for those who who got the lowest raise from central negotiations. Valid from 01. september instead of 01. july.</p><br>
            <p>09 september 2022: We refused and asked for 3,50 kr/h for all and +4 kr/h for those who who got the lowest raise from central negotiations. Valid from 01. september instead of 01. july.</p><br>
            <p>18 september 2022: We got offered 1 kr/h for all and +2 kr/h for those who who got the lowest raise from central negotiations. Valid from 01. september instead of 01. july.</p><br>
            <p id="newText">Rember that there was no local negotiations in the last 6 years that i know of. Maybe never and according to the agreement, Sodexo is obligated to have a local negotiation every year. Remeber how much money you potentially lost in the past.</p><br>
            <p id="newText">We have the right to get it from 01. july 2022 but in the offer, its valid from 01. september. We loose 2 months that we are guaranteed with the agreement. Dont forget this when voting yes or no.</p><br>
            <p id="newText">I talked to the union and they said we have good possibilities becouse of no local negotiations for many years and we should push further. If no agreement, union will take over the negotiations and they have experience with this.</p><br>
            <p id="newText">Offer should be valid from 01. july instead of 01. september.</p><br>
            <p id="newText">My opinion: I trust the union so i vote for NO. This is still too bad offer.</p><br>
            <p id="newText">Voting ends at tuesday morning, 27. september 2022.</p><br><br>
            <p>We need more members to have better position in negotiations.</p><br><br>
            <p>I have received feedback that current chef jackets are too warm and lack ventilation. In a few cases it has caused itching and irritated skin. If there are more people struggling with it, send an e-mail or SMS. There will be new uniforms soon, so if we get new uniforms, you must give us feedback as soon as possible. Also talk to colleagues about this, even those who are not members.</p><br>
